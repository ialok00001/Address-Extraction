# Address-Extraction


The purpose of this repository is in the name itself. It is made to extract Indian addresses from the web pages as much as possible while reducing the amount of other text present on it. This project was made to check how much space savings and address extraction can be made using just coding and commonly known text libraries. That is why, no machine learning libraries have been used here.

Without any changes to the text extracted from a collection of 5 web pages, the code had a space-saving of 91.74%.
After adding the address extraction codes, we were able to achieve a best saving of 98.14% with all the addresses extracted completely.

Along with this, it was tested on 10 other unknown web pages (unknown, because they were not known while making of this project, otherwise the project could have included properties of addresses in those web pages) and achieved a space-saving of 99.45% with all the addresses extracted >=95%

We just wanted to show the capabilities of non-ML techniques that could still be used in our daily tasks. This also gives us the advantage of making variations to our tasks as much as possible, which are mostly restricted in ML Libraries.
